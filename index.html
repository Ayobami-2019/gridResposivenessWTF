                "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and fond it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weks was the best - and most gruling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup"

            <p>"Before joining the bootcamp. I've never written a line of cod. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged o enrol by a formal student of theirs who can only say wondrful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular was oustanding. It took learning to the next level in a way that no tutorialcould ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviewa as an exampleof my development experience. It took my learning learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my deelopment experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended!"</p>
